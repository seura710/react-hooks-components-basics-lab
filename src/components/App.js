// Two components, <Navbar> and <Home>, are already defined in the App.js file. Display both of these components as child components of <App>.

// Create a third component, <About>. The <About> component should also be a child component of <App>.

// The <About> component should return a <div> with an id of about. To match the screenshot, the div should contain an <h2> element with the text "About." However, as long as it has an id of about, it will pass the test!
